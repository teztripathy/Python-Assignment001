Exercise -1: File name - ex1.py
Implement the function ruler() which takes a number (for example, 43) as argument,
and produces output as shown below. 
         1         2         3         4
1234567890123456789012345678901234567890123

Exercise -2: File name - ex2.py
Implement the function isWhiteLine(), which takes a string and returns TRUE if the
string contains only white space & tab characters.

Making use of the above function, write a program, which should read a file given as
command-line argument, and print only non-blank lines onto the standard output.

Exercise -3: File name - ex3.py
Implement the function isListOfInts(), which takes a list, and checks if the list has
only "int" type values, as per the specification given below:
• The function should return True, if the list has only "int" type values, otherwise
should return False.
• The function should return True, if an empty list is passed as argument.
• If the argument is not of ‘list’ type, then the function should throw ValueError
exception, with the error message 'arg not of <list> type'
• The function should have only one return statement. To test correctness of the function isListOfInts(),implement the function testList()
which is called as shown below and should produce output as indicated.
